# Investment Processing from Simulation Cart

## Overview
Updated the cart validation flow to properly create investments in the portfolio when users confirm their cart from the simulation page. This ensures that the balance, profit, and "Répartition des Investissements" (pie chart) are all updated correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. UserDashboard.jsx
**Added Props to Header:**
```javascript
setInvestmentHistory={setInvestmentHistory}
addUserInvestment={addUserInvestment}
getSectorFromName={getSectorFromName}
```

These functions are now passed to Header so it can create actual investments when processing the cart.

### 2. Header.jsx
**Updated Props:**
Added three new props:
- `setInvestmentHistory` - Updates local investment history state
- `addUserInvestment` - Adds investment to shared context for charts
- `getSectorFromName` - Determines investment sector/category

**Enhanced `handleConfirmInvestment` Function:**
Now processes each cart item as a real investment:

```javascript
cartItems.forEach((item) => {
  const amount = parseFloat(item.amount);
  
  // Calculate initial profit based on ROI
  const profitRate = (item.roi?.annual || 5) / 1000;
  const initialProfit = Math.max(1, Math.round(amount * profitRate));
  
  // Create investment object
  const newInvestment = {
    id: Date.now() + Math.random(),
    name: item.name,
    amount: amount,
    currentValue: amount + initialProfit,
    profit: initialProfit,
    date: new Date().toLocaleDateString("fr-FR"),
    sector: getSectorFromName(item.name),
    return: `+${((initialProfit / amount) * 100).toFixed(1)}%`
  };
  
  // Add to investment history (for portfolio display)
  setInvestmentHistory((prev) => [newInvestment, ...prev]);
  
  // Add to shared context (for charts and analytics)
  addUserInvestment({
    picture: item.image || "",
    nameProduct: item.name,
    category: getSectorFromName(item.name) || "other",
    valueInvested: amount,
    currentValue: amount + initialProfit,
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    roi_product: item.roi?.annual || 5
  });
});
```

   - Displays confirmation modal with:
     - All product details
     - Total amount
     - Current balance
     - New balance after investment

5. **Investment Processing**
   - User clicks "Confirmer"

   - **For each cart item:**
     - Creates investment object
     - Calculates initial profit
     - Adds to investmentHistory
     - Adds to shared context

## Automatic Updates

### Real-time Profit Growth
The system includes automatic profit simulation:
- Every 30 seconds, profits increment by 2 MAD per product
- Simulates realistic market growth
- Visible in pie chart and portfolio displays

### Portfolio Recalculation
Triggered automatically when investments change:
- Total invested recalculates
- Current value updates
- ROI percentage recalculates
- Sector breakdown updates
- Performance history rebuilds

## Data Persistence

All investment data is persisted to localStorage:
- `investmentHistory` - Array of investment objects
- `investmentCart` - Current cart items
- `userBalance` - Current account balance
- All data survives page refreshes

## Investment Object Structure

```javascript
{
  id: number,                    // Unique timestamp + random
  name: string,                  // Product name
  amount: number,                // Investment amount (MAD)
  currentValue: number,          // amount + profit
  profit: number,                // Current profit (MAD)
  date: string,                  // Date in DD/MM/YYYY format
  sector: string,                // Investment sector/category
  return: string                 // Percentage return (e.g., "+0.2%")
}
```

## Context Integration

```javascript
// Shared context structure
{
  picture: string,               // Product image URL
  nameProduct: string,           // Product name
  category: string,              // Sector (actions, obligations, etc.)
  valueInvested: number,         // Initial investment
  currentValue: number,          // Current value with profit
  date: string,                  // ISO date string
  roi_product: number            // Annual ROI percentage
}
```
